Odin Recipes Project
This is my first crack at an HTML website with the Odin Project.
Honestly I'm kind of proud of how easy it was. Sure, it's simple, and there are only a couple recipes, but it came together easily.
More than the HTML, I'm really grateful for the git knowledge I've acquired so far through TOP.
It is really neat to be able to save and publish your work so easily.
